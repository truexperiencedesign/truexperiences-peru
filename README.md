# TrueXperiences Peru — Static Site

A modern, dark‑themed travel site (hero collage, Tours menu, reviews, popular tours, contact, tips/blog).

## Customize
- Replace SVGs in `/assets` with your real images.
- Update contact info in the Contact section.
- To embed Google/Trustindex reviews, paste their widget snippet inside the `.reviews` section.
- No build step: pure HTML/CSS/JS.

## Deploy
Push to GitHub (branch `main`) and connect the repo on Netlify with Publish directory `/`.
